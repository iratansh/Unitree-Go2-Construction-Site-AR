# InteraConstruction: AR Construction Site for Physical GO2 Robot

## Project Summary

**InteraConstruction** is a Unity-based research platform that projects a virtual construction environment as AR holograms onto the real world using a Meta Quest headset. A physical GO2 EDU robot navigates through this projected environment, following paths generated by Unity's A* pathfinding scripts. The system is designed for human-robot interaction studies, allowing participants to observe and interact with a real robot as it moves through a dynamic, holographic construction site.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity** (2020.3.19f1): Core engine for 3D environment, AR, and simulation
- **Meta Quest (Oculus) SDK**: For AR passthrough and headset deployment
- **Unity XR Plugin Management**: Cross-platform XR/AR support
- **UDP Networking**: Real-time communication with the physical GO2 robot
- **Newtonsoft.Json**: Data serialization for robot communication
- **A* Pathfinding**: Custom or Unity-based path planning for robot navigation
- **Spatial Audio**: 3D audio for immersive AR experiences

## Key Features

- **AR Construction Projection**: See your Unity construction site as holograms in the real world.
- **Physical Robot Integration**: Real GO2 robot navigates the AR site, controlled by Unity pathfinding.
- **Flexible Path Planning**: Test and deploy A* and other algorithms directly to the robot.
- **Spatial Audio**: All scene sounds are spatialized for immersive AR.
- **Research-Ready**: Designed for user studies in human-robot interaction.

## Acknowledgements

The base environment for this project is adapted from the open-source **InteraConstruction** simulator, a Unity 3D simulation game developed to provide a realistic construction site setting.
